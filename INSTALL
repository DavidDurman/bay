Project: Learning Bayes network structure from data
Author: David Durman, 2008

REQUIREMENTS:

- GNU/Linux OS
- g++ 4.1.2 (older versions were not tested)
- dlib 17.11 (older versions were not tested) [http://dlib.net]
- galib 2.4.7 (older versions were not tested) [http://lancet.mit.edu/ga/dist/]

OPTIONAL:

(- python 2.4 (older versions were not tested))


dlib and galib are supposed to be in standard locations:

- dlib: /usr/local/include/dlib
- galib: /usr/local/include/ga, /usr/local/lib/

but you can use other locations after modifying makefile.


INSTALL:

1. unpack dlib library and copy the dlib folder to /usr/local/include/
2. unpack galib library and copy the ga folder to /usr/local/include/
3. run make inside the galib unpacked directory and copy the ga/libga.a to /usr/local/lib/
4. run make inside the bay src folder

That's it.

Then try: 
	./baybuild -h
	./baypredict -h
	(./bayname.py)
